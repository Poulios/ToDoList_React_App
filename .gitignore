What to learn next
Congrats! Youâ€™ve now made a to do list using React hooks. If you found this to be fairly straightforward, play around with the code a bit and try to implement more functionality.

Here are some extra things you can do to give you some ideas:

1. Add the ability to create a due date for each task or a priority rating
2. Give the ability to sort the list by the due date or priority

3. Delete button for each element
4. Create a backend so your To Do List can persist
5. Style application using React-Bootstrap or CSS-in-JS
6. Employ the Context API by using the useContext hook instead of local state and props
